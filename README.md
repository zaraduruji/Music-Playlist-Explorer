### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt a bit unprepared in completing the stretch featutues and getting the shuffled button to actually be implemented but yes the topics in the lab  was really helpful wsith learning the b asic structure for the html, css and javascript.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  I would love to have done the last stretch feature which is the sorting and I would also love to have added a toggle button that would have switch between light and dark mode when  clicked on.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Implemnting the modal feature, like count and delete button went well but I had difficulties with the shuffle button and getting the data.js to be implemented in my playlist cards.
